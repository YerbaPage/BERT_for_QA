Selected optimization level O1:  Insert automatic casts around Pytorch functions and Tensor methods.

Defaults for this optimization level are:
enabled                : True
opt_level              : O1
cast_model_type        : None
patch_torch_functions  : True
keep_batchnorm_fp32    : None
master_weights         : None
loss_scale             : dynamic
Processing user overrides (additional kwargs that are not None)...
After processing overrides, optimization options are:
enabled                : True
opt_level              : O1
cast_model_type        : None
patch_torch_functions  : True
keep_batchnorm_fp32    : None
master_weights         : None
loss_scale             : dynamic
Warning:  multi_tensor_applier fused unscale kernel is unavailable, possibly because apex was installed without --cuda_ext --cpp_ext. Using Python fallback.  Original ImportError was: ModuleNotFoundError("No module named 'amp_C'")
